# Product Requirements Document: PM Tool Suite

## Problem Statement

**What problem does this solve?**
Product Managers struggle with scientific rigor in their experimentation process. They often:
- Create poorly structured hypotheses that lead to inconclusive A/B tests
- Lack standardized pre-test validation checks, resulting in wasted resources on flawed experiments
- Miss critical post-test analysis steps, drawing incorrect conclusions from data
- Spend excessive time on documentation (PRDs, test plans) without consistent quality

**Who experiences this problem?**
- Product Managers (primary users)
- Data Scientists and Analysts (who collaborate on experiments)
- Engineering teams (who implement based on PM documentation)
- Leadership (who approve experiments and review results)

**What's the impact of not solving it?**
- 30-40% of A/B tests fail due to poor hypothesis formulation
- Teams waste 2-3 sprints on experiments that could have been caught in pre-test validation
- Incorrect conclusions from tests lead to poor product decisions affecting millions of users
- Inconsistent documentation quality slows down product development velocity by 20-30%

## Solution Overview

**Core approach:** An AI-powered PM toolkit that enforces scientific rigor through intelligent workflows, automated checks, and real-time feedback.

**Key features (MVP):**
1. **Hypothesis Builder with Scoring** - Interactive tool that guides PMs through structured hypothesis creation with real-time quality scoring
2. **Pre-Test Validator** - Automated checklist and validation engine that catches common experiment design flaws
3. **Post-Test Analyzer** - Guided analysis workflow ensuring statistical significance and practical significance are properly evaluated
4. **Smart PRD Generator** - Template-driven PRD creation with AI assistance for completeness and clarity
5. **A/B Test Document Builder** - Standardized test documentation with automatic linkage to hypotheses and results

**Explicit non-goals:**
- Not replacing existing A/B testing platforms (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly)
- Not building statistical computation engines (will integrate with existing tools)
- Not creating project management features (will integrate with Jira/Linear)
- Not handling experiment implementation or feature flagging

## Technical Design

**Tech stack choices:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite (for fast development and type safety)
- Backend: Bun + Hono (lightweight, performant API framework)
- AI Integration: OpenAI API for content generation, Anthropic for analysis
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
- Authentication: Lucia Auth with OAuth providers
- Deployment: Railway for easy scaling

**High-level architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   React UI  │────▶│  Hono API   │────▶│  PostgreSQL │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │AI Providers │
                    │(OpenAI/Claude)│
                    └─────────────┘
```

**Key technical decisions:**
- Modular architecture allowing features to be used independently
- API-first design for future integrations
- Real-time collaboration using WebSockets for shared documents
- Webhook system for integrating with existing PM tools

**Major dependencies:**
- A/B testing platform APIs (for pulling actual test results)
- Analytics platforms (Amplitude, Mixpanel) for metrics validation
- Document storage (S3 or similar) for generated artifacts

## Success Metrics

**Primary metric:** Experiment success rate improvement (target: 25% increase in conclusive A/B tests)

**Supporting metrics:**
- Time to create hypothesis: Reduce from 2 hours to 30 minutes
- Pre-test catch rate: Identify 80% of flawed experiments before launch
- Documentation consistency score: 90%+ adherence to best practices
- User adoption: 50% of PMs using tool daily within 6 months

**How to measure:**
- Integration with A/B testing platforms to track success rates
- In-app analytics for time tracking and feature usage
- Quality scoring algorithms for documentation
- User surveys and NPS scores

## Development Plan

**Phase 1 (MVP): [3-4 weeks]**
- Core hypothesis builder with basic scoring algorithm
- Simple pre-test checklist (manual validation)
- Basic PRD template generator
- User authentication and workspace setup

**Phase 2 (Enhancement): [3-4 weeks]**
- AI-powered hypothesis improvement suggestions
- Automated pre-test validation with integrations
- Post-test analysis workflow
- Collaborative editing features

**Phase 3 (Polish): [2-3 weeks]**
- Advanced scoring algorithms
- Integration marketplace (Jira, Amplitude, etc.)
- Custom template builder
- Analytics dashboard for experiment performance

## Risks

**Top 3 technical risks:**
1. **AI hallucination in suggestions** - Mitigation: Human-in-the-loop validation, confidence scoring
2. **Integration complexity with diverse A/B platforms** - Mitigation: Start with 2-3 major platforms, build adapter pattern
3. **Real-time collaboration conflicts** - Mitigation: Implement CRDT or operational transformation

**Top 3 project risks:**
1. **Feature creep from PM feedback** - Mitigation: Strict MVP scope, regular user councils
2. **Adoption resistance due to workflow changes** - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, champion program
3. **Data privacy concerns with AI processing** - Mitigation: On-premise option, clear data policies

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

1. **AI-powered vs Rule-based scoring:** Chose AI for flexibility and continuous improvement, accepting higher initial complexity
2. **Standalone tool vs Plugin architecture:** Chose standalone for better UX control, may limit adoption initially
3. **Real-time collaboration vs Async workflows:** Chose real-time to match modern PM workflows, accepting technical complexity
4. **Generic vs Opinionated templates:** Chose opinionated approach to drive best practices, may limit flexibility for some teams

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with BHVR stack ✓
2. Design database schema for hypotheses, tests, and documents ✓
3. Create wireframes for hypothesis builder UI
4. Implement basic authentication flow
5. Build MVP of hypothesis builder with simple scoring

## Success Criteria for MVP

- User can create account and workspace
- Complete hypothesis creation flow with quality score
- Generate basic PRD from template
- Export documents in Markdown/PDF
- 10 beta users providing positive feedback
