# Product Requirements Document: Pre-Experiment Check Tool

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge

Product teams waste 30-40% of their experiments due to poor planning. Without proper validation, teams run tests that are doomed to fail, wasting weeks of development time and missing opportunities to improve their products.

### The Solution

The Pre-Experiment Check Tool is an intelligent workspace that guides Product Managers through structured hypothesis creation using a conversational form interface. It uses advanced AI to analyze and improve hypotheses, calculates the right sample size with visual tools, and validates experiment designs - all before any development begins.

### Business Impact

- **Save 2-3 weeks** per experiment by catching design flaws early
- **Increase experiment success rate by 25%** through structured hypothesis design
- **Reduce decision-making time from hours to minutes** with automated calculations
- **Build PM expertise** with AI-powered coaching and feedback

### Investment Required

- 3-month development timeline
- 4-person team (Product, Design, 2 Engineers)
- LLM API costs for hypothesis analysis

## Problem Definition

### Who Experiences This Problem?

**Primary Users: Product Managers**

- Struggle to write clear, testable hypotheses
- Unsure about required sample sizes for their experiments
- Waste time on manual calculations and guesswork
- Face pressure to show results but lack scientific rigor

**Secondary Users: Leadership Teams**

- Need confidence in experiment decisions
- Want to optimize resource allocation
- Require clear documentation of experiment rationale

### The Real Cost of Poor Experiment Design

**Time Waste**

- Average failed experiment costs 3 weeks of development time
- PMs spend 2+ hours manually calculating sample sizes
- Teams run experiments for wrong durations (too short or unnecessarily long)

**Business Impact**

- Poor decisions based on inconclusive results
- Missed opportunities to improve key metrics
- Reduced team morale from repeated experiment failures
- Loss of stakeholder trust in the experimentation process

### Why Current Solutions Fall Short

**Manual Calculations**

- Error-prone and time-consuming
- Require statistical knowledge many PMs lack
- Don't provide guidance on hypothesis quality

**Generic Calculators**

- Disconnected from actual business context
- No integration with experiment platforms
- Lack visual feedback and interpretation

## Solution Overview

### What Is the Pre-Experiment Check Tool?

An intelligent workspace where Product Managers can validate their experiment ideas before implementation. Think of it as a "spell-checker" for experiments - it catches mistakes before they become costly failures.

### Core Capabilities

**1. Guided Hypothesis Builder**

- Step-by-step form interface (like Typeform)
- Forces structured thinking with required fields
- AI-powered analysis after submission
- Specific, actionable improvement suggestions

**2. Visual Sample Size Calculator**

- Interactive sliders for key parameters
- Live graphs showing trade-offs
- Plain English explanations
- Preset templates for common scenarios

**3. Experiment Timeline Predictor**

- Calendar view of experiment duration
- Traffic input for duration calculations
- Risk indicators for common pitfalls
- Go/no-go recommendations

**4. Documentation Generator**

- Auto-formatted experiment plans
- Stakeholder-ready summaries (PDF/Markdown)
- One-click export functionality

### What This Tool Won't Do

- Won't run the actual experiments
- Won't integrate with other tools (standalone solution)
- Won't make decisions for you (provides recommendations)
- Won't replace statistical analysis tools (focuses on pre-experiment phase)

## User Journey

### Sarah's Story: From Idea to Validated Experiment

**Step 1: Guided Hypothesis Creation (5 minutes)**
Sarah starts the hypothesis builder and is greeted with a friendly, conversational interface:

_Screen 1_: "What change do you want to test?"

- Sarah types: "Change checkout button color to green"

_Screen 2_: "Who will see this change?"

- Multiple choice options + custom field
- Sarah selects: "Mobile users" and adds "in the US market"

_Screen 3_: "Why do you think this will work?"

- Sarah writes: "Our user research shows green is associated with 'go' and security"

_Screen 4_: "What impact do you expect?"

- Sarah enters: "Increase checkout conversion rate by 10%"

_Screen 5_: "How will you measure success?"

- Checkboxes for common metrics + custom fields
- Sarah selects: "Conversion rate", "Revenue per visitor"

The tool assembles her hypothesis: "We believe that changing the checkout button to green for mobile users in the US market will increase checkout conversion rate by 10% because our user research shows green is associated with 'go' and security. We'll know this is true when we see improvements in conversion rate and revenue per visitor."

**Step 2: AI-Powered Analysis (30 seconds)**
Sarah clicks "Analyze My Hypothesis" and the AI provides feedback:

‚úÖ **Strengths:**

- Clear intervention specified
- Target audience defined
- Measurable outcome included

üîß **Improvements Needed:**

- "Your expected lift of 10% is ambitious. Based on similar color change experiments, 2-5% is more realistic."
- "Consider adding a secondary metric like 'cart abandonment rate' to catch any negative effects."
- "Your reasoning could be stronger. Include specific data: '73% of users in our survey said...'"

**Improved Score: 7/10**

**Step 3: Sample Size Calculation (2 minutes)**
Sarah moves to the calculator with her hypothesis pre-filled:

- Current conversion rate: 3.2% (she enters)
- Minimum detectable effect: 3% (AI-suggested based on feedback)
- Interactive graphs show she needs 25,000 users per variant

**Step 4: Timeline Planning (1 minute)**
Based on her traffic input (5,000 users/day), the tool shows:

- Experiment duration: 10 days
- Calendar view with start/end dates
- Warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è Includes weekend - traffic may vary"

**Step 5: Export Documentation (30 seconds)**
Sarah clicks "Generate Experiment Plan" and downloads:

- PDF summary for stakeholders
- Markdown file for documentation
- Hypothesis scorecard with improvement history

### Total Time: 9 minutes (vs. 2+ hours manually)

## Key Features Deep Dive

### 1. Guided Hypothesis Builder with AI Analysis

**Conversational Form Interface**

- Step-by-step questions that build a complete hypothesis
- Each step requires completion before proceeding (no skipping)
- Dynamic paths based on user responses
- Required fields with validation ensure quality inputs
- Progress indicator shows completion status
- Cannot submit for analysis until all steps are complete

**The "We Believe That" Framework**
Every hypothesis follows this structure:

- **We believe that** [intervention]
- **For** [target audience]
- **Will result in** [measurable outcome]
- **Because** [reasoning based on data/insights]
- **We'll know this works when** [success metrics]

**AI-Powered Feedback Engine**
Using advanced language models to provide:

- Contextual suggestions based on your industry
- Realistic lift expectations from similar experiments
- Missing element identification
- Risk warnings (e.g., "This might affect page load time")
- Alternative hypothesis suggestions
- Use Websearch & Context 7 to get the latest SDK details for LLMs
- Have support for OpenAI o3-mini, Claude Sonnet 4 & Google gemini 2.5 pro

**Scoring Methodology**
Hypotheses are scored on five dimensions:

1. **Clarity** (Is the change specific and clear?)
2. **Measurability** (Can we track the outcome?)
3. **Reasoning** (Is there evidence supporting this?)
4. **Scope** (Is it focused on one change?)
5. **Testability** (Can we run this experiment?)

### 2. Interactive Sample Size Calculator

## Conclusion

The Pre-Experiment Check Tool transforms experiment design from a time-consuming, error-prone process into a quick, confident decision. By catching problems before they become expensive failures, we'll help Product Managers run better experiments, make better decisions, and ultimately build better products.

**Next Steps**:

1. Approve PRD and allocate resources
2. Begin design sprint for UI/UX
3. Set up beta program recruitment
4. Select LLM provider and negotiate pricing
