# TICKET-038: Step 2 "Target Audience" Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented Step 2 of the hypothesis builder with all the requested features:

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Checkbox Group UI**
   - 8 preset audience options with multiple selection support
   - Clean, accessible checkbox interface using shadcn/ui components

2. **Preset Audience Options**
   - All users (100%)
   - Mobile users (~65%)
   - Desktop users (~35%)
   - New visitors (~40%)
   - Returning customers (~25%)
   - Logged-in users (~30%)
   - High-value customers (~10%)
   - Cart abandoners (~15%)

3. **Custom Audience Input**
   - "Other (specify)" checkbox option
   - Conditional text input field that appears when selected
   - 200 character limit with counter
   - Auto-focus when activated

4. **Tooltips**
   - Informative tooltips for each audience option
   - Explains what each audience segment represents
   - Accessible hover interaction

5. **Audience Size Estimation**
   - Dynamic calculation based on selected segments
   - Visual display with icon and prominent percentage
   - Handles overlapping audiences intelligently

6. **Validation**
   - Requires at least one audience selection
   - OR a custom audience with minimum 10 characters
   - Continue button disabled until valid

7. **Best Practices Section**
   - Tips for effective audience targeting
   - Guidance on statistical significance
   - Reminder about excluding internal users

## Files Modified/Created:

1. **Created**: `/client/src/components/hypothesis/steps/StepTwo.tsx`
   - Full implementation of Step 2 component
   - 290 lines of clean, well-documented code

2. **Updated**: `/client/src/types/hypothesis-builder.ts`
   - Added `TargetAudience` interface
   - Updated `HypothesisFormData` to use new type
   - Updated `StepProps` to handle the new type

3. **Updated**: `/client/src/components/hypothesis/HypothesisBuilder.tsx`
   - Updated initial state for targetAudience
   - Modified validation logic for Step 2
   - Added TargetAudience import

4. **Installed**: shadcn/ui components
   - checkbox
   - tooltip

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Type Structure:
```typescript
interface TargetAudience {
  selected: string[];      // Array of selected audience IDs
  customAudience?: string; // Optional custom audience description
}
```

### Component Features:
- State management for checkbox selections
- Dynamic "Other" input visibility
- Character counting with color-coded warnings
- Audience size calculation algorithm
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Accessible markup with proper labels and ARIA attributes

### UI/UX Considerations:
- Consistent with Step 1 design patterns
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive layout
- Interactive tooltips for guidance
- Real-time validation feedback
- Smooth transitions and focus management

The implementation follows the established patterns from Step 1 and is ready for testing and integration with the rest of the hypothesis builder workflow.
